# # Post.create!(user_id: 11, country_code: 'THA', content: 'Le Jardin Secret is a wonderful place for a solo traveler, and I highly recommend visiting if you're on your own. You will have a chance to take your time, explore the palace and gardens, and sit and relax and enjoy for awhile - maybe in a couple different spots you will find. If you are on your own you will want Google Maps on your phone to get you there easily and to get you back out of the Medina. The admission is 80 DH - about $8 and well worth it. There is an on-site cafe, though I didn't use it. The origins of the complex date back to the Saadian Dynasty, more than four hundred years ago. Rebuilt in the mid-Nineteenth century at the behest of an influential Kaid of the Atlas Mountains, Le Jardin Secret has been the home of some of Morocco and Marrakech‚Äôs most important political figures. Today it can be appreciated by the public thanks to the recent renovation. Le Jardin Secret is part of the great tradition of stately Arab-Andalusian and Moroccan palaces. As a result visitors can discover its gardens and buildings, which are outstanding examples of Islamic art and architecture.', category: 2, image: 'https://cktravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/le-jardin-secret-marrakech_12.jpg', city: 'Marrakech')

From the moment we were greeted and met by Hamid at our driver‚Äôs car, to the welcome tea and introduction to the Riad from Anna, to our delicious rooftop dinner served by Ayman, to the unforgettable cooking class with Mama Fatima and Naima after an exciting trip to the souk to buy the ingredients with Anna and Hamid, we felt like treasured guests in their home. (If you are interested in a cooking class, this one was fantastic.
