**As a user, I can:**
- Spin the globe to randomly choose my next travel destination
- Search for a specific destination (autofill-enabled)
- See other travellers' posts, including stories, images and positive reviews
- Post my own stories or interact with (via likes/comments) other users' posts if I am logged in

Likely Required APIs:
- Google Maps
- Yelp
- TripAdvisor(?)
- Photos API(s) for destinations' sample images, as well as profile pic/avatar data
- Some kind of blog post/text content API for sample posts

Stretch goals:
- Globe shows little pop-ups with snippets from posts when landing on a location after spinning the globe (featured pop-ups may be random, or generated based on popularity of interactions, meaning the most likes/comments)
- Hashtags
- Save favorited posts to personal account history when logged in
- See details for reviewed places/businesses
- Custom logo by me
- Extensive library of user posts for most countries, so that when a user spins the globe and lands on any country, they can see at least some content

🚨🚨Highest priority:🚨🚨
- Spinning globe on homepage
- Interactivity capabilities with globe (geo-location enabled)
- Login w/ auth
- GET posts by country
- User can like/comment on a post
- Categorize posts by accommodations, restaurants, experiences associated with each country
- Posts include text and images
- Acquire domain name/host with AWS

Medium priority:
- Expand locations/users so there is a large volume of content
- Hyperlink to businesses from posts
- Filter by most popular posts
- Map with pins for popular tourist destinations in the area
- Hashtags

Lowest priority:
- Thumbnail pop-ups on globe showing the traveller's profile photo
- See only photos for selected location
- Search reviews for keywords
- User account page to show activity (my posts + liked/commented-on posts)
